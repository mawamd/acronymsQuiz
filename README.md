# acronymsQuiz
Self-Quiz by typing out acronyms

This is a simple script that lets you:
1. Add new acronyms, which are saved in same directory as new_acronyms.json
2. Test yourself on existing acronyms

The idea behind this is that it will ask you a term (e.g. VACTERL) then ask you to type out each letter.

This initial version is for learning, so it will give you the answer as a hint and then you type it out until you have it mastered.

Happy learning!
