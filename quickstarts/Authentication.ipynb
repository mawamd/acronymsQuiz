            "* **Clearer Function Definitions:** Each function is clearly defined with a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value. This makes the code much more understandable.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**  The code now explicitly differentiates between the two main ways to sort lists in Python:\n",
            "    * `sorted(my_list)`: This is a *built-in function* that creates a *new* sorted list without modifying the original.  This is generally preferred when you want to keep the original list intact.\n",
            "    * `my_list.sort()`:  This is a *method* of the list object that sorts the list *in place*.  It *modifies* the original list directly.  This is more efficient if you don't need to keep the original list.\n",
            "* **In-Place Sorting Example:**  The code includes a dedicated function `sort_list_in_place()` to demonstrate how to use `list.sort()` and highlights that it modifies the original list.  The return value is explicitly `None` because the function's purpose is the side effect of modifying the list, not to return a new one.\n",
            "* **Custom Key Function:**  The `sort_list_with_key()` function provides a powerful way to sort based on a custom criterion.  The example demonstrates sorting a list of strings by their length.  The `key=len` argument tells `sorted()` to use the `len` function to determine the sorting order.\n",
            "* **Descending Order Sorting:** A function `sort_list_descending()` shows how to sort in reverse (descending) order using the `reverse=True` argument in `sorted()`.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Examples:**  Each function has a clear example of how to use it, making the code very easy to understand and adapt. The original list is printed before *and* after sorting to make the changes very clear.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  Comprehensive docstrings are included for each function to explain its purpose, arguments, and return value. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
            "* **Comments:**  Helpful comments are added throughout the code to explain key steps.\n",
            "* **Error Handling (implicit):**  The examples assume the input lists contain comparable elements.  In a production environment, you might want to add error handling to check if the elements are of a compatible type before attempting to sort them.  If not, you could raise a `TypeError`.\n",
            "* **Readability:** Consistent formatting and naming conventions make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
